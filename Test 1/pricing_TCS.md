# Pricing Analysis - TCS (Tata Consultancy Services)

## 1. Pricing Assumptions

| Assumption | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Delivery model (onshore/offshore %) | 40% onshore, 60% offshore | TCS typically leverages their extensive Indian delivery centers while maintaining local presence for client-facing roles and compliance with 80% local requirement through contractors |
| Rate positioning (premium/market/discount) | Market to slight discount | TCS often positions 10-15% below Big 4 rates while maintaining quality perception. They use offshore leverage to maintain margins |
| Margin strategy | Aggressive to win (20-25% target) | TCS likely views this as strategic - first major Salesforce win with NSW Government could open doors. Will price competitively while protecting baseline margin through offshore mix |
| Risk buffer | 10-12% contingency | Complex government transformation with legacy migration and multiple integrations requires conservative risk buffer |
| Partner ecosystem | Leverage existing relationships | TCS has strong partnerships with Salesforce and Microsoft which could reduce licensing costs by 5-8% |

## 5. Competitive Positioning Rationale

### Why TCS Would Bid at This Level:

1. **Strategic Account Value**: First major Salesforce implementation with NSW Government - worth investing to establish presence
2. **Offshore Leverage**: 60% offshore delivery maintains healthy margins despite competitive pricing
3. **Competition Awareness**: Knows IBM and Deloitte will bid premium; positions 15-20% below them
4. **Volume Play**: 15,000 users represents significant ongoing license revenue opportunity
5. **Support Services Hook**: Implementation is entry point to lucrative 3-year support contract

### Key Pricing Tactics:
- **Front-load Value**: Aggressive Phase 1 pricing to demonstrate capability
- **Risk Mitigation**: Higher contingency for complex government requirements
- **License Optimization**: Leverage Salesforce partnership for better rates
- **Local Compliance**: Use contractor model to meet 80% local requirement while maintaining offshore cost advantage

## 6. Optional Support Services Pricing (3 Year)

| Year | Support Model | Annual Cost |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Year 1 | Full support team (8 FTE equivalent) | $1.8M |
| Year 2 | Optimized team (6 FTE equivalent) | $1.4M |
| Year 3 | Steady state (5 FTE equivalent) | $1.2M |
| **Total Support** | | **$4.4M** |

## Analysis Summary

TCS would likely bid **$16.5M** for implementation (middle of range) with strong emphasis on:
- Proven government transformation methodology
- Global Salesforce expertise with local delivery presence  
- Competitive pricing through offshore leverage
- Risk mitigation through experienced team and conservative planning

Their main vulnerability would be perception of offshore delivery in sensitive government environment, which they would counter with strong local leadership and compliance framework.
