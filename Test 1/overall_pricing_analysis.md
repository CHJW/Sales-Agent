## Competitive Pricing Landscape

### Price Range Analysis

| TCS | $16.0M - $17.0M | Market to slight discount | Medium |
| IBM | $28.5M - $29.5M | Premium positioning | Medium |

### Average Market Price
- Mean: $27.0M
- Median: $28.5M
- Range: $16.0M - $40.0M

## Pricing Pressure Indicators
- Budget mentioned in RFP: Yes - $8.5M - $12M (implementation) + $2.5M - $4M (optional support)
- Weight of price in evaluation: 15% (relatively low for government RFP)
- Evidence of price sensitivity: 
  - Low price weighting (15%) suggests quality over cost focus
  - Fixed budget envelope with limited contingency mentioned
  - RFP budget significantly below competitor estimates indicates potential budget adjustment during evaluation

## Recommended Accenture Pricing Strategy

### Price Positioning
[X] Below market (-25%) - Strategic positioning to win

### Recommended Bid Range
- Minimum viable: $18.5M
- Target: $20.0M
- Walk-away: $22.0M

### Pricing Rationale

**Strategic Positioning Between Premium and Discount Players**
Accenture should position between TCS's aggressive discount approach ($16-17M) and the premium players (IBM at $28-29M, Deloitte at $36-40M). At $20M, we're approximately 25% below market average while maintaining healthy margins and demonstrating serious commitment to winning.

**Leveraging Existing Relationship Value**
With our existing SAP project relationship and leadership connections at DCJ, we can justify a slight premium over TCS while still being significantly more competitive than IBM and Deloitte. The 15% price weighting means we don't need to be the lowest bidder - we need to demonstrate value at a reasonable price point.

**Risk-Adjusted Pricing for Complex Government Transformation**
Given the complexity (15,000 users, 25+ integrations, sensitive data), our $20M target includes appropriate risk buffers while remaining competitive. This positions us as the "smart choice" - not suspiciously cheap like TCS might appear, but not overpriced like the Big 4 consultancies.

### Pricing Levers

| Lever | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Offshore mix | Increase to 55% offshore delivery | -$2.0M |
| Phasing | Front-load critical deliverables, back-load nice-to-haves | Improved cashflow, client confidence |
| Risk sharing | 10% at-risk tied to user adoption metrics | Client appeal, demonstrates confidence |
| Strategic investment | Absorb licensing markup, focus on services margin | -$0.5M but improves win probability |
| Accelerated delivery | Compress Phase 1 from 8 to 6 months | +$1.0M in efficiency gains |

### Detailed Pricing Breakdown

**Implementation Services: $20.0M**
- Phase 1 Foundation (8 months): $4.5M
- Phase 2 Expansion (10 months): $6.5M  
- Phase 3 Statewide (18 months): $7.0M
- Program Management & Governance: $2.0M

**Optional Support Services (3 years): $5.5M**
- Year 1: $2.2M (full support during hypercare)
- Year 2: $1.8M (optimized support model)
- Year 3: $1.5M (steady state operations)

**Total Contract Value: $25.5M**

### Win Strategy Pricing Tactics

1. **Address Budget Gap Proactively**
   - Acknowledge RFP budget of $8.5-12M is based on outdated assumptions
   - Demonstrate how our $20M delivers 2x the value through efficiency and risk mitigation
   - Offer phased contracting to work within annual budget constraints

2. **Differentiate from Competitors**
   - vs TCS: Higher quality, better risk management, stronger change management
   - vs IBM: 30% lower cost with equal technical capability
   - vs Deloitte: 50% lower cost while leveraging existing relationship

3. **Value Engineering Options**
   - Core implementation: $20M (recommended)
   - Reduced scope option: $16M (defer mobile, reduce integrations)
   - Enhanced option: $24M (accelerated timeline, premium support)

4. **Commercial Flexibility**
   - Milestone-based payments aligned to budget cycles
   - Performance incentives tied to user adoption
   - Shared savings model for efficiency gains

### Risk Mitigation in Pricing

- 12% contingency built into all phases
- Separate line items for high-risk integrations
- Clear assumptions and exclusions documented
- Change control process for scope creep

### Competitive Intelligence Response

Given that:
- TCS will likely bid aggressively at $16.5M to establish government presence
- IBM will maintain premium at $29M relying on brand and security credentials  
- Deloitte will leverage existing relationship but at prohibitive $38M price

Our $20M positions us as the optimal choice - technically capable, financially reasonable, and relationship-proven.

## Recommendation Summary

**Bid at $20.0M for implementation with the following key messages:**
1. "Right-sized" pricing that reflects true project complexity
2. Proven delivery capability with existing DCJ relationship
3. Balanced approach between cost and quality
4. Significant savings versus Big 4 consultancies
5. Superior value and lower risk than offshore-heavy competitors

This pricing strategy maximizes our win probability while maintaining acceptable margins and positions Accenture as the trusted, value-conscious partner for DCJ's critical transformation.
