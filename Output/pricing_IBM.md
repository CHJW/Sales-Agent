## Key Pricing Insights

### IBM's Competitive Positioning
1. **Premium Play**: IBM will position at the high end of the RFP budget range ($8.5M-$12M), likely coming in well above at ~$29M to reflect the true complexity
2. **Risk Transfer**: High contingency and conservative estimates reflect IBM's approach to government projects - they'll price in all risks upfront
3. **Offshore Leverage**: Despite premium rates, IBM will use 60% offshore delivery to maintain margins while meeting the 80% local requirement through strategic onshore placement

### Pricing Strategy Rationale
- **Brand Premium**: IBM leverages their government track record and security credentials to justify 10-15% premium over competitors
- **Full Solution**: Unlike competitors who might price just the implementation, IBM will include all licensing, tools, and infrastructure in their bid
- **Change Focus**: Heavy investment in change management (15% of labour) reflects IBM's understanding that user adoption is critical for government

### Competitive Intelligence
- IBM likely knows the RFP budget range is unrealistic for the scope
- They'll use their existing government relationships to influence budget discussions
- Their pricing assumes they can negotiate a budget increase during the evaluation process
- The high price also serves to anchor expectations - even if they negotiate down 20%, they're still at healthy margins

### Win Probability Factors
- **Strengths**: Government track record, security credentials, global delivery capability
- **Weaknesses**: High price point, potential perception as "old school" vs modern competitors
- **Strategy**: IBM will emphasize risk mitigation, proven delivery, and total cost of ownership rather than compete on price
