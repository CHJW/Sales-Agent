## Opportunity Scoring Framework (100 Points)

### Strategic Alignment: 22/25 Points
**Score Rationale:** Excellent strategic fit with some qualification gaps

**Evidence:**
- **Government Transformation Focus (+8):** Aligns perfectly with Accenture's public sector strategy and digital transformation expertise
- **Existing DCJ Relationship (+7):** Current SAP implementation provides unique insider advantage and proven delivery track record
- **Scale and Complexity (+5):** 15,000 users across 200+ offices demonstrates significant transformation scale suitable for Accenture capabilities
- **Geographic Expansion Potential (+2):** NSW implementation with potential national expansion creates long-term strategic value
- **Case Study Gap (-3):** Limited ANZ government Salesforce implementations reduce strategic positioning strength

**Key Insights:**
- DCJ represents gateway to broader NSW Government opportunities
- Success would establish Accenture as premier Salesforce government implementer in ANZ
- Builds on existing relationship rather than cold pursuit

### Win Probability: 18/25 Points
**Score Rationale:** Strong competitive position with execution risks

**Evidence:**
- **Relationship Advantage (+8):** Current SAP project success and leadership connections (Sarah Mitchell, Michael Chen, Jennifer Walsh) provide significant influence
- **Differentiated Win Themes (+6):** Four accepted win themes directly address DCJ pain points with unique proof points
- **Competitive Landscape (+4):** Deloitte's advisory-only experience, TCS offshore risks, IBM premium pricing create positioning opportunities
- **Technical Requirements Gaps (-3):** ANZ Salesforce case studies weakness against R045 (minimum 5 government implementations >$2M)
- **Price Positioning Challenge (-2):** Need to justify premium over TCS while remaining competitive with IBM/Deloitte
- **Delivery Complexity Risk (-5):** 15,000 users, 25+ integrations, sensitive data handling, aggressive timeline (6-month pilot)

**Competitive Assessment:**
- **vs Deloitte (High Threat):** Strategy experience vs our execution capability
- **vs TCS (Medium Threat):** Price advantage neutralized by local delivery requirements
- **vs IBM (Medium Threat):** Strong technical credentials but poor user adoption history

### Financial Attractiveness: 20/25 Points
**Score Rationale:** Strong revenue opportunity with acceptable margins

**Evidence:**
- **Contract Value (+10):** $20M implementation + $5.5M support = $25.5M total contract value over 3 years
- **Margin Potential (+5):** Recommended pricing at $20M allows healthy 25-30% margins with existing DCJ relationship reducing business development costs
- **Payment Terms (+3):** Government client provides payment security and milestone-based structure
- **Follow-on Potential (+2):** National expansion and ongoing support create long-term revenue streams
- **Budget Risk (-3):** RFP budget ($8.5-12M) significantly below market estimates, requiring client education
- **Performance Penalties (-2):** 2% monthly fee reduction per percentage point below 85% user adoption creates downside risk

**Financial Summary:**
- Revenue: $25.5M over 3 years
- Target margin: 28% ($7.1M gross profit)
- ROI on pursuit investment: High (existing relationship reduces pursuit costs)

### Risk/Reward Balance: 18/25 Points
**Score Rationale:** Manageable risks with high reward potential

**Evidence:**
- **Delivery Risk (-4):** Complex integration requirements (SAP, Justice Health, Centrelink, Land Registry) with aggressive timeline
- **User Adoption Risk (-3):** 15,000 field workers with historical resistance to change and financial penalties for <85% adoption
- **Security/Compliance Risk (-2):** PROTECTED classification and sensitive child protection data requires absolute security compliance
- **Case Study Gap Risk (-3):** Limited ANZ government Salesforce experience may impact evaluation scoring (20% of total)
- **Competitive Intelligence (+5):** Existing relationship provides early insight into client priorities and competitor positioning
- **Proven Delivery Model (+3):** Current SAP success demonstrates ability to navigate DCJ's complex stakeholder environment
- **Government Reference Value (+2):** Success creates powerful reference for future government Salesforce opportunities

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Partner with Salesforce ANZ for reference validation
2. Leverage global government Salesforce credentials with local methodology emphasis  
3. Implement aggressive change management program with measurable adoption milestones
4. Utilize existing DCJ integration knowledge to de-risk technical complexity

1. **ANZ Case Study Mitigation (Critical)**
   - Secure 3 ANZ government Salesforce reference relationships through partner network
   - Develop compelling transferable experience narrative from global projects
   - Partner directly with Salesforce ANZ for credibility enhancement

2. **Technical Risk Mitigation (High Priority)**

   - Confirm security clearance capacity for required NV1 personnel

3. **Competitive Intelligence (Ongoing)**

   - Create field worker-specific design artifacts demonstrating user-centric approach
   - Prepare detailed adoption success stories from comparable implementations

### Rationale for Conditional Go

**Why Pursue:**
The DCJ Salesforce opportunity represents a high-value, strategically aligned project that leverages Accenture's strongest competitive advantages: existing client relationship, proven delivery capability, and integration expertise. The $25.5M contract value with healthy margins, combined with the potential for long-term support and expansion opportunities, makes this an attractive financial proposition. Most importantly, our current SAP implementation success provides unprecedented access and credibility that competitors cannot replicate.

**Managing the Risks:**
While the ANZ Salesforce case study gap represents a significant challenge (impacting 20% of evaluation scoring), this can be mitigated through strategic partnerships, compelling methodology narrative, and leveraging our unique DCJ operational knowledge. The technical complexity and user adoption risks, while substantial, align with Accenture's proven government transformation capabilities. The existing relationship provides early warning systems for competitive threats and client priority shifts.

**Strategic Value Beyond Revenue:**
Success on this engagement would establish Accenture as the premier government Salesforce implementer in ANZ, creating a powerful reference for future opportunities across Australian state governments. The combination of Salesforce platform expertise with government transformation capability represents a strategic capability gap in the market that Accenture is uniquely positioned to fill.
