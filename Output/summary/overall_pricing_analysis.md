## Competitive Pricing Landscape

### Price Range Analysis

| Competitor Type | Estimated Bid Range | Pricing Strategy | Confidence |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|------------|
| Global SI (Premium) | $600K - $900K | Value positioning | Medium |
| Global SI (Aggressive) | $500K - $700K | Market capture | Medium |
| Cloud Native Vendors | $450K - $650K | Technology-led | Medium |
| Regional Players | $400K - $550K | Price competition | Medium |
| **TestCorp (Benchmark)** | **$450K** | **Fixed-price competitive** | **High** |

### Average Market Price
- **Mean:** $550,000 (estimated)
- **Median:** $525,000 (estimated)
- **Range:** $400,000 - $900,000

## Pricing Pressure Indicators

| Indicator | Finding | Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Budget mentioned in RFP** | Yes - $500K-$1M implementation | Moderate flexibility |
| **Weight of price in evaluation** | 30% (Cost Effectiveness) | Price is important but not dominant |
| **Annual cost cap** | $200K annually | Hard constraint |

### Evidence of Price Sensitivity
1. Explicit budget range indicates cost consciousness
2. Annual cost cap suggests ongoing budget constraints
3. "Cost effectiveness" as evaluation criterion (not just lowest price)
4. Fixed-price contract preference indicates cost overrun aversion

## Recommended Accenture Pricing Strategy

### Price Positioning
- [ ] Below market (-10-15%) - Win at all costs
- [x] **At market - Competitive positioning**
- [ ] Above market (+10%) - Value positioning

**Rationale:** With only 30% weight on cost and 40% on technical capability, price should be competitive but not the primary lever. Quality and experience matter more.

### Recommended Bid Range

| Component | Amount | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Minimum Viable** | $480,000 | Floor price maintaining minimal margin |
| **Target** | $550,000 | Competitive mid-market positioning |
| **Walk-away** | $650,000 | Premium positioning with full value |

### Annual Recurring

| Component | Amount | Constraint |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Target** | $160,000 | Competitive with headroom |
| **Maximum** | $195,000 | Under $200K cap |

---

## Pricing Rationale

**Market Positioning**: The recommended target of $550,000 positions Accenture competitively within the stated budget range while maintaining healthy margins. The TestCorp benchmark at $450,000 represents aggressive pricing that Accenture should not match directly, instead focusing on value differentiation.

**Win Probability vs Margin Trade-off**: With technical capability weighted at 40% and experience at 30%, a slightly premium price can be offset by superior technical approach and proven track record. The recommendation balances win probability (~60-70% at target price) against margin requirements.

**Risk Factors**:
- Fixed-price contract requirement increases delivery risk
- Integration complexity (ERP/CRM) may require contingency
- Aggressive timeline (20 weeks) requires efficient delivery

## Pricing Levers

| Lever | Description | Impact | Risk |
|-------|-------------|--------|------|
| **Offshore Mix** | Increase offshore delivery to 30-40% | -$50K to -$80K | Quality perception |
| **Phasing** | Back-load costs to Phase 2-3 | Improved cashflow | Delivery risk |
| **Risk Sharing** | Outcome-based component (10-15%) | Client appeal | Margin variability |
| **Scope Optimization** | Phase optional components | -$30K to -$50K | Competitive disadvantage |
| **Training Reduction** | Self-service training options | -$15K to -$25K | Adoption risk |
| **Support Tiering** | Standard vs premium support | -$20K to -$40K annually | SLA exposure |
