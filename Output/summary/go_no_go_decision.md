## Recommendation

### [x] CONDITIONAL GO - Pursue with conditions

**Conditions for Full Pursuit:**

1. **Resource Confirmation**: Confirm availability of certified cloud architects for Q1 2024 delivery
2. **Clarification Questions**: Submit RFI for timeline/uptime inconsistencies identified in analysis
3. **Pricing Validation**: Internal pricing team approval of fixed-price approach
4. **Reference Preparation**: Secure 3 comparable government references willing to participate

## Rationale

**Strategic Value**: This opportunity represents strong alignment with Accenture's cloud transformation practice and government sector focus. The technical-heavy evaluation criteria (40% weight) favors our capability-led approach over pure price competition. The $500K-$1M contract value with recurring revenue potential makes this a worthwhile pursuit.

**Competitive Position**: While specific competitors were not identified, market analysis suggests we can compete effectively against both global SIs and regional players. Our combination of local ANZ presence with global cloud expertise provides a unique positioning. The identified win themes (Guaranteed Reliability, Seamless Integration, Risk-Free Transformation) directly address client pain points and evaluation criteria.

**Risk Assessment**: The primary risks are manageable: (1) fixed-price delivery requires disciplined scope management, (2) aggressive 20-week timeline needs efficient delivery methodology, and (3) integration complexity requires proven approach. The inconsistencies identified in the RFP (timeline dates, uptime specifications) should be clarified before final pricing commitment.
