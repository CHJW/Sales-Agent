## Rejected Win Themes

| Theme | Rejection Reason | What Would Make It Viable |
|-------|------------------|---------------------------|
| "Industry-Leading Cloud Partner" | Generic - all major SIs claim cloud partnership status. AWS/Azure partnerships are commoditized. | Specific exclusive partnership capability or named joint solution |
| "Experienced Delivery Team" | Fails competitor test - every bidder will claim experienced teams. No differentiation. | Named individuals with specific client outcomes, unique certifications |
| "Cost-Effective Solution" | Price is 30% of evaluation; technical (40%) is higher weighted. Competing on cost alone loses the technical battle. | TCO analysis showing long-term savings, not just low initial price |
| "Innovative Technology" | Vague and unsubstantiated. "Innovation" is overused in proposals. | Specific patented technology, proprietary asset, or named innovation outcome |
