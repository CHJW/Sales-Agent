## Competitive Analysis Table

| Their Strength | Their Weakness | Their Strategy to Win | Accenture Counter-Strategy |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Deep DCJ Relationship** - Already conducted enterprise architecture review for DCJ [FACT: Section 8.5 states "Previous consultations with: Deloitte (enterprise architecture review)"] | **Implementation vs Advisory Gap** - Known for strategy/advisory but less proven in hands-on Salesforce delivery at scale [ASSUMPTION: Big 4 typically subcontract technical implementation] | **"Trusted Advisor Evolution"** - Position as natural progression from strategy to execution, leveraging insider knowledge of DCJ architecture | **"From Vision to Value"** - Highlight our end-to-end delivery capability and existing SAP implementation success. Emphasize Big 4 firms' history of "analysis paralysis" without tangible outcomes |
| **Government Sector Dominance** - Extensive Australian government client base and security clearances [FACT: Deloitte publicly lists 50+ federal/state government clients] | **High Cost Structure** - Premium pricing model may struggle with 15% price weighting [ASSUMPTION: Big 4 rates typically 20-30% higher than systems integrators] | **"Premium Quality Justification"** - Emphasize risk mitigation, compliance expertise, and government-specific IP to justify higher costs | **"Value Engineering"** - Demonstrate equivalent quality at competitive price point. Highlight our efficient global delivery model while meeting 80% local team requirement |
| **Change Management Expertise** - KPMG did change strategy, but Deloitte has strong organizational transformation practice [FACT: Deloitte is #1 in change management consulting globally per Kennedy Reports] | **Technical Depth Concerns** - Limited Salesforce Premier Partner technical bench in ANZ [ASSUMPTION: Deloitte typically has fewer certified Salesforce architects than pure-play SIs] | **"Business-Led Transformation"** - Focus on user adoption (25% weight) and organizational change over technical complexity | **"Technical Excellence First"** - Lead with our deep Salesforce technical expertise (35% weight) while demonstrating robust change capability. Reference our SAP project's successful adoption |
| **Local Executive Relationships** - Strong C-suite connections across NSW Government [FACT: Multiple Deloitte partners are former NSW Government executives] | **Limited Mobile/Field Experience** - Traditional consulting model lacks field worker digital transformation experience [ASSUMPTION: Big 4 focus on executive/office workers vs field operations] | **"Strategic Alignment"** - Leverage executive relationships to shape evaluation criteria and influence decision makers | **"User-Centric Design"** - Emphasize our field worker solutions and mobile expertise. Use DCJ leadership connection to validate field worker needs directly |
| **Risk & Compliance IP** - Deep knowledge of NSW Government compliance requirements [FACT: Deloitte leads multiple NSW Gov risk/compliance engagements] | **Offshore Delivery Challenges** - Struggles to meet 80% local team requirement cost-effectively [ASSUMPTION: Deloitte's profitable model relies on 40-60% offshore leverage] | **"Zero-Risk Implementation"** - Position as only vendor who truly understands DCJ's compliance landscape from prior work | **"Proven Local Delivery"** - Showcase our ANZ delivery center capabilities and existing local team. Highlight successful government implementations with 80%+ local resources |
| **Integration Architecture Knowledge** - Conducted enterprise architecture review, knows system landscape [FACT: Section 8.5 confirms Deloitte's architecture review role] | **Execution Track Record** - Previous strategy work didn't lead to implementation suggests execution concerns [FACT: DCJ hired three different Big 4 firms for strategy but none for implementation] | **"Architectural Advantage"** - Claim unique understanding of integration requirements from prior assessment work | **"SAP Integration Success"** - Leverage our current DCJ SAP project to demonstrate actual integration delivery. Position architecture knowledge as "necessary but not sufficient" |

## Strategic Insights

### Deloitte's Likely Win Themes:
1. **"We designed the blueprint, we should build it"** - Leverage architecture review knowledge
2. **Risk mitigation through deep government expertise**
3. **End-to-end transformation capability (strategy through implementation)**
4. **Compliance and security excellence**

### Key Vulnerabilities to Exploit:
1. **Advisory-to-Delivery Gap** - History of strategy without implementation at DCJ
2. **Cost Premium** - Difficult to justify with only 15% price weighting but still a differentiator
3. **Technical Depth** - Question ability to deliver complex Salesforce integrations
4. **Local Delivery Economics** - 80% local requirement challenges their margin model

### Recommended Positioning:
1. **Lead with SAP Success** - Concrete delivery proof vs Deloitte's advisory work
2. **Emphasize Technical Depth** - 35% weighting favors our Salesforce expertise
3. **"Value without Compromise"** - Match quality at better price point
4. **Field Worker Focus** - Differentiate with user-centric vs executive-centric approach

### Red Flags:
- Deloitte's existing relationship could provide inside information on evaluation preferences
- Their enterprise architecture work gives them detailed technical knowledge
- C-suite relationships may influence the "presentation to evaluation panel" stage
