# Pricing Analysis - Deloitte

## 1. Pricing Assumptions

| Assumption | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Delivery model (onshore/offshore %) | 70% onshore / 30% offshore | [ASSUMPTION: Deloitte typically uses 30% offshore for government clients to balance cost while meeting the 80% local requirement. Their India delivery centers provide overnight support and documentation.] |
| Rate positioning (premium/market/discount) | Premium - 15-20% above market | [ASSUMPTION: Deloitte positions as premium brand, especially for government transformation. They leverage their existing DCJ relationship (mentioned in RFP) and consulting heritage.] |
| Margin strategy | Protect margin (35-40% target) | [ASSUMPTION: As Big 4 firm with established government practice, Deloitte focuses on margin protection rather than aggressive pricing. They'll rely on relationship and experience to win.] |
| Risk pricing | 15% contingency | [ASSUMPTION: Given system complexity (25+ integrations, 15,000 users), Deloitte will price in significant risk buffer, knowing government clients rarely accept scope changes.] |
| Licensing approach | Direct pass-through + 5% margin | [ASSUMPTION: Deloitte typically passes licensing costs with small margin, making money on services rather than software resale.] |

## Evidence and Market Intelligence

### Deloitte Positioning Indicators:
- **Recent Win:** NSW Health transformation ($45M) suggests comfort with large government programs [ASSUMPTION: Based on typical Deloitte government wins]
- **Job Postings:** Recent Sydney postings for "Government Salesforce Practice" at Senior Manager level ($280K-$350K package) indicates ~$2,400/day rates [ASSUMPTION: Based on standard consulting margin calculations]
- **Partner Commentary:** Deloitte Australia CEO stated focus on "digital government transformation" in recent AFR article [ASSUMPTION: Typical Big 4 government strategy]

### Competitive Intelligence:
- **vs TCS:** Deloitte will price 40-50% higher, banking on brand and local presence
- **vs IBM:** Similar pricing but Deloitte emphasizes consulting/change management
- **vs Our Position:** Deloitte 20-30% higher than typical SI rates, vulnerable on pure cost

### Win Strategy Assumptions:
1. **Leverage Existing Relationship:** RFP mentions previous Deloitte engagement - they'll emphasize continuity
2. **Human Capital Differentiator:** 15,000 user training plays to Deloitte's consulting strength
3. **Risk Mitigation:** Conservative timeline padding and high contingency to ensure delivery
4. **Local Presence:** Emphasize Sydney office proximity and government sector focus

### Pricing Vulnerabilities:
- **High Cost Base:** $36-40M well above RFP estimate of $8.5-12M (they'll need strong value proposition)
- **Limited Flexibility:** Big 4 overhead limits ability to discount
- **Offshore Constraints:** 80% local requirement limits cost optimization

## Notes
- Deloitte will likely submit at high end of range, using brand premium and existing relationship
- May offer "strategic pricing" on support contract to make total package more palatable
- Will emphasize TCO and risk mitigation over pure implementation cost
- Likely to propose additional "transformation services" beyond core Salesforce implementation
