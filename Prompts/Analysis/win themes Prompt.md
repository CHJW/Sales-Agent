DIFFERENTIATION CRITERIA (all must pass for acceptance):
- [ ] Competitor test: Could major competitors credibly claim this? If yes, reject or sharpen.
- [ ] Strategic alignment: Theme should exploit competitor weaknesses or reinforce Accenture's strategic advantages identified in competitor analysis.
- [ ] Proof point uniqueness: Generic partner status or awards insufficient alone — require named client outcomes, proprietary assets, or exclusive capabilities.
- [ ] Client relevance: Theme must map to stated evaluation criteria or buyer pain points.

AVOID:
- Generic implementation/delivery experience claims
- Industry certifications without specific client outcomes
- Themes any major global SI could equally claim
