TASK: Extract evaluation/marking criteria from this RFP/RFI and provide strategic insights.

EXTRACT (preserve original structure and terminology):

1. SCORING/MARKING CRITERIA
   - Extract as-is: categories, weights, points, scales
   - Preserve section references
   - Use table format matching source document

2. MANDATORY/PASS-FAIL REQUIREMENTS
   - Requirements that must be met to qualify
   - Section references

3. SELECTION PROCESS (if stated)
   - Stages, timeline, decision points

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Mirror source document structure where possible
- Use tables if source uses tables
- "Not specified" for absent elements — do not infer

STRATEGIC INSIGHTS (add at end):
- Where is the weight concentrated? (technical vs price vs experience)
- Any unusual weightings or criteria?
- What does this reveal about client priorities?
- Red flags or areas needing clarification?
