## Rejected Win Themes

| Theme | Rejection Reason | What Would Make It Viable |
|-------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Global Salesforce Innovation Leadership | Competitors (especially Capgemini) have stronger global Salesforce scale and partnership credentials - this theme plays to their strengths rather than differentiating Accenture | Specific evidence of Australia-first Salesforce innovations, locally developed IP, or exclusive capabilities not available to global competitors |
| Digital Transformation Strategy Partnership | Too generic - both Deloitte and Capgemini can credibly claim transformation expertise. Evaluation criteria emphasize operational delivery over strategic consulting | Narrow focus to "human services transformation" with specific Australian regulatory and legislative expertise that competitors lack |
| Cost Efficiency & Value Optimization | With only 10% evaluation weighting on price/value, and Big 4 competitors likely to compete on premium positioning, cost leadership theme is strategically weak | Specific quantified efficiency gains unique to Accenture's delivery model (automation, AI, proprietary tools) that competitors cannot replicate |
| Platform Integration Mastery | Capgemini has strong MuleSoft partnership and integration credentials - this theme allows them to compete on their strength area | Focus on "legacy government system integration" expertise specific to Australian compliance frameworks and DCJ's 47 systems |
| Change Management Excellence | Both major competitors (Deloitte and Capgemini) have strong change management practices and can compete equally on this theme | Narrow to "vulnerable population change management" requiring trauma-informed approaches and cultural sensitivity specific to human services |

## Potential Win Themes (Evidence Required)

| Theme | Strategic Value | Evidence to Source |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Salesforce Platform Currency & Innovation | Would counter Capgemini's global Salesforce scale by demonstrating cutting-edge platform knowledge and early access to new features | Australian Salesforce COE case studies, Innovation Partner status proof, early adopter program participation, platform roadmap influence evidence |
| Remote NSW Service Delivery Mastery | Strong differentiation against Sydney-centric competitors - addresses DCJ's 334 offices across metro/regional/remote NSW | Regional NSW government contracts, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community engagement evidence, remote connectivity solutions, local workforce programs |
| Human Services Regulatory Compliance Leadership | Highly defensible position leveraging Australian legislative knowledge that international competitors cannot easily replicate | Australian Privacy Principles implementation, Working with Children Checks integration, mandatory reporting compliance systems, NDIS data protection frameworks |
| Government Procurement Excellence | Could exploit competitors' weaknesses in understanding NSW Government procurement frameworks and probity requirements | GITC framework compliance history, NSW Procurement shared services references, probity advisor testimonials, social procurement outcome measurement |
| Continuous Innovation Investment Model | Addresses DCJ's need for ongoing platform evolution and emerging technology adoption without additional cost burden | R&D investment allocation, innovation lab partnerships, emerging technology pilot programs, platform evolution roadmap, cost-neutral enhancement delivery model |
