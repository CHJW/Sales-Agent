## 1. PRICING ASSUMPTIONS

| Assumption | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| **Delivery model (80% onshore / 20% offshore)** | Deloitte will emphasize local delivery for government sector, using offshore only for development and testing activities. Strong preference for Australian-based resources given security clearance requirements and client proximity expectations. |
| **Rate positioning (Premium market)** | Deloitte typically prices 10-15% above market rates, justified by brand reputation, methodology rigor, and senior resource allocation. For government work, will position as "value premium" rather than pure premium. |
| **Margin strategy (Protective with competitive elements)** | Deloitte will protect healthy margins (25-30%) while being competitive enough to win. Likely to offer volume discounts and value-added services to justify premium positioning. |
| **Resource allocation (Senior-heavy model)** | Higher proportion of senior/principal resources compared to typical market, reflecting Deloitte's brand positioning and client expectations for government work. |
| **Government sector premium** | Additional 5-10% premium for government complexity, compliance requirements, and security clearance overhead. |
| **Long-term relationship focus** | Pricing to establish long-term partnership rather than maximize short-term margins, given potential for follow-on work and references. |
