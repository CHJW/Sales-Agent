### 1.2 Executive Summary

The NSW Department of Communities and Justice (DCJ) is the largest human services agency in Australia, serving over 500,000 individuals and families across New South Wales through critical services in child protection, social housing, disability support, and youth justice. DCJ operates with approximately 15,000 staff across 334 offices and facilities throughout metropolitan, regional, and remote NSW locations.

DCJ is currently undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation program to replace multiple legacy case management systems with a unified, modern Salesforce platform. This transformation represents one of the largest government technology modernization initiatives in Australia, with an estimated total program value of $450 million over seven years.

The current technology landscape presents significant challenges:
- **System Fragmentation:** Over 47 different legacy systems across service areas
- **Data Silos:** Critical client information scattered across incompatible platforms
- **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual processes consuming 35% of caseworker time
- **Client Experience:** Fragmented service delivery requiring clients to repeat information
- **Compliance Risk:** Aging systems unable to meet modern security and privacy standards
- **Maintenance Cost:** Annual legacy system maintenance exceeding $85 million

**Digital Transformation Vision:**
DCJ's digital transformation aims to create a unified, client-centric service delivery platform that:
- Provides a single view of clients across all DCJ services
- Enables seamless information sharing between caseworkers and service providers
- Automates routine processes to increase time available for direct client support
- Delivers modern, accessible digital services for clients and partners
- Meets the highest standards for security, privacy, and compliance
- Supports evidence-based decision making through advanced analytics

### 1.3 Detailed Opportunity Overview

**Strategic Context:**
This Application Managed Services (AMS) engagement forms a critical component of DCJ's "Connected Communities" digital transformation program, which is replacing legacy systems with an integrated Salesforce ecosystem. The program represents the NSW Government's largest investment in human services technology and aims to fundamentally transform how DCJ delivers services to vulnerable individuals and families.

**Current State Challenges:**
DCJ currently operates multiple disconnected legacy systems that create significant barriers to effective service delivery:

1. **KiDS (Child Protection System)** - A 25-year-old COBOL-based system managing child protection cases
2. **HOMES (Housing Management System)** - A client-server application managing social housing applications and tenancies
3. **DisabilityCRM** - A basic CRM system for disability services coordination
4. **CYMS (Youth Justice Management System)** - A case management system for youth justice services
5. **Multiple Service Provider Portals** - Over 20 different systems used by external service providers

These legacy systems result in:
- **Inefficient Caseworker Processes:** Average 4.2 systems accessed per client interaction
- **Poor Client Experience:** Clients required to provide same information multiple times
- **Data Quality Issues:** Inconsistent and incomplete client records across systems
- **Limited Analytics:** Inability to gain insights across service areas
- **High Maintenance Costs:** Annual maintenance and support costs exceeding $85M
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Legacy systems unable to meet modern cyber security standards
- **Compliance Challenges:** Difficulty meeting reporting and audit requirements

**Target State Solution:**
The Salesforce platform implementation will deliver:

**Core Platform Components:**
- **Service Cloud:** Unified case management across all DCJ service areas
- **Experience Cloud:** Client and service provider self-service portals
- **Field Service Lightning:** Mobile capabilities for field-based workers
- **MuleSoft Anypoint:** Enterprise integration platform connecting all systems
- **Tableau CRM:** Advanced analytics and reporting capabilities
- **Knowledge Management:** Centralized knowledge base for staff and clients

**Business Applications:**
1. **ChildStory** - Comprehensive child protection case management
2. **HousingPathways** - Social housing applications and tenancy management
3. **DisabilityConnect** - Disability services coordination and NDIS integration
4. **CommunityServices** - Community-based programs and support services
5. **ProviderPortal** - External service provider collaboration platform

**Expected Benefits:**
- **40% reduction** in time spent on administrative tasks
- **60% improvement** in client satisfaction scores
- **25% reduction** in duplicate assessments and processes
- **$45M annual savings** in operational costs by Year 3
- **99.7% system availability** replacing current 92% average
