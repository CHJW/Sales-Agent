- **Risk Factors:** High competition from established players; complex technical requirements; aggressive pricing environment

### Financial Attractiveness: 19/25

**Score Rationale:**
- **Revenue Quality (8/10):** Government contract with 99.7% payment certainty; 7-year potential provides revenue security

## RECOMMENDATION

☑️ **GO - Pursue with full resources**

### RATIONALE

**Primary Strategic Imperative:** The DCJ Salesforce AMS opportunity represents a transformational win for Accenture Australia that justifies full pursuit commitment. This engagement offers the rare combination of significant revenue scale ($69.7M-$101.3M), strategic market positioning (Australia's largest government human services digital transformation), and defensible competitive advantage (Australian delivery model + human services domain expertise).

**Competitive Analysis Supports Aggressive Pursuit:** Comprehensive analysis reveals clear pathways to victory against primary competitors. Capgemini's premium pricing model ($23.66M-$25.15M) and limited Australian AMS scale create significant cost advantage opportunities. Deloitte's federal government focus leaves NSW relationship gaps that Accenture can exploit. Our target pricing of $19.2M (14% below market average) combined with superior Australian delivery capabilities and human services domain expertise creates compelling value proposition that competitors cannot match.

**Risk-Adjusted Value Creation:** While the engagement requires margin compression to achieve competitive positioning, the strategic value substantially outweighs short-term profitability impacts. The 7-year contract duration provides revenue security and market position that enables substantial follow-on opportunity capture across NSW Government and the broader $485M digital transformation program. The fixed-price structure is manageable through proven risk mitigation strategies including 7% contingency allocation, robust change management processes, and performance-based fee structures that align client and vendor interests.
