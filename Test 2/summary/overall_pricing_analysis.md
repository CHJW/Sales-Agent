## Recommended Accenture Pricing Strategy

### Price Positioning
☑ **Below market (-8% to -12%)** - Competitive positioning to win flagship government account

### Recommended Bid Range
- **Minimum viable**: $16.8M (highly aggressive, margin compression)
- **Target**: $19.2M (competitive positioning, sustainable margins)
- **Walk-away**: $21.5M (market rate, standard margins)

### Pricing Rationale

**Competitive Market Dynamics**: The DCJ Salesforce AMS opportunity represents a highly competitive tier-1 consulting market with Capgemini positioning at premium rates ($23.66M-$25.15M) and Deloitte showing more aggressive pricing flexibility ($18.5M-$22.0M). Both competitors will leverage their government relationships and Salesforce partnership status, but face cost structure challenges that Accenture can exploit.

**Strategic Win Importance vs Margin Trade-off**: This engagement offers significant strategic value beyond immediate margins - serving as a flagship government reference, providing access to NSW's largest human services digital transformation, and positioning for the broader $450M program value over seven years. The initial 3-year term with two 2-year extension options creates long-term revenue potential that justifies aggressive initial pricing to secure the relationship.

**Risk-Adjusted Positioning**: Accenture should position at $19.2M (14% below market average) to create compelling value proposition while maintaining service delivery excellence. This pricing accounts for: (1) Fixed-price risk over 3 years, (2) Security clearance costs and compliance overhead, (3) 24x7 support requirements, (4) Integration complexity with 47+ legacy systems, and (5) Government reporting and governance requirements.

### Pricing Levers

| Lever | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Offshore mix** | Increase offshore delivery to 35% (vs competitors' 20-30%) | -$1.8M |
| **Resource optimization** | Right-size team with senior/mid-level mix optimization | -$1.2M |
| **Phasing** | Front-load transition costs, optimize steady-state delivery | Improved cashflow |
| **Enhancement model** | Fixed monthly pool vs pure T&M approach | Cost predictability |
| **Risk sharing** | Performance-based fee component (5% of annual value) | Client appeal |
| **Local capability** | 90% Australian delivery vs offshore-heavy models | +$0.8M premium |

## Competitive Differentiation Strategy

### Against Capgemini ($23.66M-$25.15M)
- **Price advantage**: $4.5M-$6.0M lower (19-24% savings)
- **Delivery model**: More agile, less methodologically heavy
- **Local presence**: Stronger Australian resources and commitment
- **Innovation focus**: Practical innovation vs theoretical applied innovation

### Against Deloitte ($18.5M-$22.0M)
- **Price competitiveness**: $0M-$2.8M advantage at target pricing
- **Service delivery**: More streamlined operations, faster response times  
- **Technology focus**: Pure Salesforce specialization vs broad consulting
- **Government experience**: Equal capability with more flexible commercial approach
