## COMPREHENSIVE DEPARTURE DECLARATION FRAMEWORK

### Purpose and Strategic Context

This Statement of Departures serves as a critical component of DCJ's procurement evaluation process, designed to ensure transparency, manage risk, and facilitate informed decision-making. The document enables systematic identification, assessment, and management of any variations from RFP requirements while maintaining procurement integrity and competitive fairness.

**Document Objectives:**
- **Transparency:** Ensure complete disclosure of all variations from specified requirements
- **Risk Management:** Enable proactive identification and mitigation of proposal risks
- **Competitive Fairness:** Provide equal opportunity for all vendors to declare departures
- **Evaluation Efficiency:** Streamline evaluation process through structured departure assessment
- **Contract Clarity:** Establish clear baseline for contract negotiations

### Comprehensive Departure Definition and Scope

A **"departure"** is defined as any aspect of your proposal that does not fully comply with, varies from, or proposes alternatives to the stated requirements in any of the following documents:

**Primary RFP Documentation:**
- **RFP Part 1 - Particulars and Conditions:** Contract framework, evaluation criteria, submission requirements
- **RFP Part 2 - Deliverables:** Service delivery requirements, performance standards, deliverable specifications
- **Attachment A - Non-Price Response:** Response requirements, evaluation criteria, mandatory compliance
- **Attachment B - Technical Specification:** Technical requirements, system architecture, service levels
- **Attachment C - Cyber Security:** Security requirements, compliance frameworks, certification needs
- **Attachment E - Pricing Schedule:** Pricing structure, payment terms, commercial requirements

**Contractual and Legal Documentation:**
- **Draft Contract Terms and Conditions:** Legal obligations, liability, intellectual property
- **Service Level Agreements:** Performance targets, availability requirements, response times
- **Insurance Requirements:** Coverage types, minimum amounts, policy conditions
- **Compliance Requirements:** Regulatory compliance, audit requirements, reporting obligations

**Supplementary Requirements:**
- **NSW Government Policies:** Procurement policies, security policies, environmental policies
- **Industry Standards:** Technical standards, professional certifications, quality frameworks
- **Submission Requirements:** Format specifications, evidence requirements, declaration processes

### Critical Departure Management Principles

#### 1. Complete Disclosure Requirement
**All departures must be comprehensively documented** - failure to declare any departure may result in:
- Immediate proposal disqualification during evaluation
- Contract breach if discovered post-award
- Exclusion from future DCJ procurement processes
- Legal action for misrepresentation

#### 2. Departure Finality
**Departures cannot be introduced after submission** - only departures explicitly listed in this document can be:
- Considered during evaluation
- Negotiated if your proposal is successful
- Incorporated into final contract terms
- Used as basis for contract variations

#### 3. Zero Departures Acceptability
**No departures is a valid and often preferred position** - many successful proposals demonstrate:
- Complete compliance with all RFP requirements
- Superior understanding of client needs
- Reduced procurement risk and complexity
- Simplified evaluation and contract negotiation

#### 4. Comprehensive Justification Requirement
**All departures must be thoroughly justified** including:
- Clear business rationale for the departure
- Detailed risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Alternative solutions that meet underlying business needs
- Quantified impact assessment on cost, time, and quality

#### 5. Value-Based Alternative Proposals
**Departures should propose superior value** through:
- Enhanced service delivery capabilities
- Improved technical solutions
- Better risk management approaches
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Innovation and competitive advantage

## GUIDANCE NOTES

### What Constitutes a Departure?

**Departures Include:**
- Any requirement you cannot or will not meet exactly as specified
- Alternative approaches that deliver the same outcome differently  
- Enhanced solutions that exceed requirements (may still be departures if they change the scope)
- Different timelines, resources, or methodologies than specified

**Not Departures:**
- Clarifications or explanations of how you will meet requirements
- Implementation details that are left to the contractor to determine
- Standard commercial terms that are already addressed in your pricing

### Tips for Managing Departures

1. **Minimize Departures:** Only declare genuine departures that are necessary for your solution
2. **Focus on Value:** Explain how your alternative approach delivers equal or better value
3. **Be Transparent:** Full disclosure builds trust - hiding departures damages credibility  
4. **Propose Solutions:** Don't just identify problems - propose workable alternatives
5. **Consider DCJ's Perspective:** Think about why the requirement exists and how to address the underlying need

### Impact on Evaluation

- **Small Number of Low-Impact Departures:** Generally acceptable if well justified
- **Large Number of Departures:** May indicate poor understanding of requirements  
- **High-Impact Departures:** Will be carefully evaluated for risk and value
- **Unjustified Departures:** May result in lower evaluation scores or elimination
